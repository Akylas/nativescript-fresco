## What is `nativescript-fresco`?

The `nativescript-fresco` plugin enables NativeScript developers to use the `FrescoDrawee` class which is extends the traditional Android ImageView component and adds the smart Fresco image management algorithms. The plugin exposes the drawee as a NativeScript view so you basically put it in the XML definition of your page and provide the URI to the image you would like to use.
